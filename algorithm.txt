What is Greedy Algorithm?
    A Greedy ALgorithm is an approach for solving problems by making the locally optimal choice at each step, with the hope that tree local choices will lead to a globally optimal solution.

    In other words:
        - Take the best possible choice at the current moment -- repeat -- until the problems is solved.

    Gready choice property:
        - THe problem has the greedy choice property.
        - The problem has optimal Substructure.
        - You need an efficient solution (usually faster than brute force or dp).

    Optimal Substructure:
        A Problem has an optimal solution that contains optimal solutions to its subproblems.

Example:
    1. You're given a list of activities 

Graph: is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges.



Real life examples:

1. Social networks

2. Google maps

3. network Topologies

Main types of graph:

1. Undirected

2. Directed

3. Weighted

4. Cyclic

Representation of graph:

1. Adjacency matrix: A 2D matrix array of size V x v , where V is the number of Vertices.

- matrix[i][j] = 1: Indicates an edge exists between vertex i and j.

- matrix[i][j] = 0; Indicates no edge exists between vertex i and j.
