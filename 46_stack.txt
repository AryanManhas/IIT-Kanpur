Stack:
	Stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO(Last in first out) principle.
	
	- Stack has one end only.
	- It contains only one pointer pointing to the topmost element of the stack.
	
	eg:
		Recursion
		Do and Un-Do mechanism.
		
	Stack Functions:
		1. push(): use to store element in stack.
		2. pop(): use to remove elment from the top of the stack.
		3. top(): Returns the element at the top of the stack without removing it.
		4. empty(): Returnns true if stack is empty otherwise false.
		5. size(): return number of elements of stack.
		
Polish Notation:
    This type of notation was introduced

- There are mainly three type of Polish Notation:
1. Infix notation:
    This polish notation in data structure states that the operator is written in between the operands.

    eg:
        ( a+b) x c ( a + b ) x contains   
        q + b  - c + data
        ( a + b) + (c / d ) ( a x b )

2. Prefix notation:
    This notation in data structure states that the operator should be present as prefix or before the operands.
    eg: 
        + a b
        + - a b c + = a b c
        x a b x a b

3. Postfix notation:
    This notation in data structure states that the operator should be present as and
    after the operands.

    - Postfix notation is a computer understandable format.  
    eg:
        a b - 
        a b / c d /
        12 5 + 3 / 12 5 + 3 /
        8 2 3 x + 8 2 3 x +
